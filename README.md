I have always had a passion for games and have wanted to work in the games industry for a number of years.Â  
In order to further that goal I have studied art at the University of Abertay where I have been given the opportunity to gain invaluable experience in games art and design.
I have taken part in the Global Game Jam as well as multiple games design projects as part of a team some of which resulted in continued employment with Eclectic Synthesis as a character and environment concept artist.
With Eclectic Synthesis I worked closely with our 3D artists to develop the final assets for our prototype.
In my own time I have worked on projects requiring me to expand my range of skills including developing a range of art styles, painting and drawing techniques, 2D and 3D animation, UI design, 3D modelling, teamwork and communication skills.

For more examples of my work I would direct you to my website (www.rjmconcepts.co.uk).
In the event that you need to contact me for more information, my email address is the most reliable method of doing so.
